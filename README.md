#ShinyDraw

(or `drawr`)

This is a work in progress for implementing drawing to get data out into an easy to use shiny module.

No shiny implementation is yet here. Currently it's getting polished as a javascript class which will then be
duct taped into a shiny module. Most likely will end up in the `shinysense` package.
